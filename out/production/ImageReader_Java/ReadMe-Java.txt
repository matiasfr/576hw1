You will find
	1) A program to display and manipulate images. This has been
given as java code to read an rgb image of the specified format explained in the homework 
and then displays it and the processed image on screen(As reference code, both should be 
the same as the original).
	2) Example images, which are in the native RGB formats. 


Unzip the folder to where you want. To run the code from command line, first compile with:

>> javac imageReader.java

and then, you can run to read a sample image (hw1_1_low_res.rgb) as:

>> java imageReader hw1_1_low_res.rgb 400 300

where, the first parameter is the image file name, second is the width and third is the height.

Or, you can install IDE for Java such as eclipse to run a Java project.
